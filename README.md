# Laravel SingleStore Backup

Laravel SingleStore Backup is a package that makes it easy to make backups of your SingleStore database using S3 Storage. Behind the scenes, this package uses the `BACKUP DATABASE` command, a native command for SingleStore.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```sh
composer require miguilim/laravel-singlestore-backup
```

## Configuring

You must add the following lines to your .env file in order to configure your S3 credentials:

```env
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_DRIVER=
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_PATH=
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_ENDPOINT=
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_BUCKET=
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_PUBLIC_KEY=
SINGLESTORE_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY=
```

## Basic Usage

Below there is a simple example of how you use the backup command. By default, the command will do a full backup.

```sh
php artisan singlestore:backup
``` 

## Init Backup

If you're making an incremental backup and want to create the `INIT` backup, you can do that by using the `--init` parameter.

```sh
php artisan singlestore:backup --init
``` 

## Differential Backup

If you're making an incremental backup and want to do a `DIFFERENTIAL` backup, you can do that by using the `--differential` parameter.

```sh
php artisan singlestore:backup --differential
``` 

## Setting multipart_chunk_size_mb Parameter

The `multipart_chunk_size_mb` must be in the range of [5..500]. By default, the chunk size is 5 MB. A larger chunk size allows users to upload large files without going over Amazonâ€™s limitation on maximum number of parts per upload. Although, a larger chunk size increases the chance of a network error during the upload to S3. If a chunk fails to upload, SingleStoreDB retries uploading it until the limit set on the number of retries by AWS is reached. Each partition will use "multipart_chunk_size_mb" MB(s) of additional memory.

```sh
php artisan singlestore:backup --multipart_chunk_size_mb=10
```

## Setting Timeout Parameter

You can set the timeout parameter, a value specified in milliseconds, to determines the length of time to wait for the `BACKUP DATABASE` command to commit across the cluster. If not specified, the `default_distributed_ddl_timeout` global variable value is used.

```sh
php artisan singlestore:backup --timeout=30000
```
